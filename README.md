# Feature Extraction with CNN and Transformer Models

This project demonstrates feature extraction from images using the following models:

- ResNet50
- ResNet101
- ResNet152
- CLIP (OpenAI)
- DINO (Self-Supervised ViT)

## Directory Structure

- `resnet/`: ResNet model scripts.
- `clip/`: CLIP-based feature extraction.
- `dino/`: DINO-based feature extraction.
- `utils/`: Helper functions.
- `data/`: Sample images for testing.
